This is my first blog post.
i intend to make it short and sweet.

First and foremost lets start with a randomly selected sample of my last report.

Cooling systems are designed to maintain engines at an optimum temperature. They keep the temperature constant irrespective of external temperature conditions. There are two types of
cooling systems: Air cooled systems and liquid cooled systems. Air cooled systems are
designed such that air passes over the cylinder heads to dissipate the heat from the source by
convection. This type of system is commonly found in old vehicles. Liquid cooled systems are
common in modern vehicles due to their efficiency. They make use of a liquid coolant
contained in a closed system and made to circulate by an impeller to remove the heat from the
engine and dissipate it into the passing airstream through a radiator.
